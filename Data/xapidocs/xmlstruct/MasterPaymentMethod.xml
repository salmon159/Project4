								Used to identify the order to which charges are applied.
								<br/>
								The Seller Organization can configure the payment types so that
								they are charged and refunded in a particular sequence. The
								charge sequence and refund sequence are independent of each
								other. A
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with a
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>0</code>
                                </b>
								is charged before another
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>1</code>
                                </b>
								.
								<br/>
								The Buyer can also specify the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								of the
								<code>PaymentMethod</code>
								in the
								<code>createOrder</code>
								input xml. If a charge sequence is not specified by the Buyer,
								the Seller's
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								is followed.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								If both the Buyer and the Seller supply
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								, charges are made in the order
								that the Seller specifies, but
								within a particular charge type, such
								as CreditCard, the Buyer's
								sequence is honored.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								For example:
								<br/>
								A seller specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 0 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, 1 for CREDIT_CARD, 2 for OTHER.
								<br/>
								A buyer specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 1 for MyBank-CreditCard, 2 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, and 3 for
								MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The payment methods are charged in the following sequence:
								<br/>
								CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, MyBank-CreditCard, MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The Customer account is charged because that is the seller's
								preferred method, and the two credit cards are charged based on
								the order that the buyer specified.

								The Seller Organization can configure the payment types so that

								charge sequence and refund sequence are independent of each
								other. A
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with a
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>0</code>
                                </b>
								is charged before another
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>1</code>
                                </b>
								.
								<br/>
								The Buyer can also specify the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								of the
								<code>PaymentMethod</code>
								in the
								<code>createOrder</code>
								input xml. If a charge sequence is not specified by the Buyer,
								the Seller's
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								is followed.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								If both the Buyer and the Seller supply
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								, charges are made in the order
								that the Seller specifies, but
								within a particular charge type, such
								as CreditCard, the Buyer's
								sequence is honored.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								For example:
								<br/>
								A seller specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 0 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, 1 for CREDIT_CARD, 2 for OTHER.
								<br/>
								A buyer specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 1 for MyBank-CreditCard, 2 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, and 3 for
								MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The payment methods are charged in the following sequence:
								<br/>
								CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, MyBank-CreditCard, MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The Customer account is charged because that is the seller's
								preferred method, and the two credit cards are charged based on
								the order that the buyer specified.

								Used to identify the order to which charges are applied.
								<br/>
								The Seller Organization can configure the payment types so that
								they are charged and refunded in a particular sequence. The
								charge sequence and refund sequence are independent of each
								other. A
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with a
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>0</code>
                                </b>
								is charged before another
								<code>PaymentType</code>
								with
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								set to
								<b>
                                    <code>1</code>
                                </b>
								.
								<br/>
								The Buyer can also specify the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								of the
								<code>PaymentMethod</code>
								in the
								<code>createOrder</code>
								input xml. If a charge sequence is not specified by the Buyer,
								the Seller's
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								is followed.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								If both the Buyer and the Seller supply
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								, charges are made in the order
								that the Seller specifies, but
								within a particular charge type, such
								as CreditCard, the Buyer's
								sequence is honored.
								<br/>
                                <br/>
								For example:
								<br/>
								A seller specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 0 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, 1 for CREDIT_CARD, 2 for OTHER.
								<br/>
								A buyer specifies the
								<code>ChargeSequence</code>
								as 1 for MyBank-CreditCard, 2 for CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, and 3 for
								MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The payment methods are charged in the following sequence:
								<br/>
								CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT, MyBank-CreditCard, MyOther-CreditCard.
								<br/>
								The Customer account is charged because that is the seller's
								preferred method, and the two credit cards are charged based on
								the order that the buyer specified.
