Existing reservations cannot be modified directly; instead, if a new reservation is created with the same reservation attributes as an existing reservation, the new reservation will be consolidated into the existing reservation, and demand will be created for the new quantity.<br/>If new quantity is being added to the order line in the same call that a reservation is being added, and the reservation matches the order line's attributes, then the reservation will be rolled up in to the order line, and the matching quantity will move to "Reserved" status.</div>
