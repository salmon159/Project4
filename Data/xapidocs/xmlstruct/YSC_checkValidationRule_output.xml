						This field is used to display the result of the validation operation. In General Usage, if no Validation Rule violations are found, then this field will be set to 'Y', 
						and conversely, if one or more violations are found, then this field will be set to 'N'. In the event that the Validation Domain is disabled, no evaluation will take place,
						and this field will be set to 'Y'. If the "External_Init_Perform" flag on the Validation is set to 'Y', then no evaluation will be performed, and instead, if any applicable
						rules are found, this field will be set to 'N'. Otherwise it will be set to 'Y'.
