Probably these are test payload which nidhi used to test the connectivity.

There was a new store ticket on which Ankur has worked on.
This was not clear that it will go live for Nebula products. 
I was working on the full sync for the same products which needed no new changes from OMS on Prod.
So this confusion



When loading the Item Master and Lot master from POS to OMS, please make sure that there is gap of at least 2 hours between each in order of Item Master -> Lot feed -> Inventory. 
Or else there will be DB lock created as it is inserted into same table for Item Master, Lot and Price feed and process will get hung up.
Same locks happened in UAE today.
